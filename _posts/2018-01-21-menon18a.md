title: The cost of fairness in binary classification
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: 'Binary classifiers are often required to possess fairness in the sense
  of not overly discriminating with respect to a feature deemed sensitive e.g. race.
  We study the inherent tradeoffs in learning classifiers with a fairness constraint
  in the form of two questions: what is the best accuracy we can expect for a given
  level of fairness?, and what is the nature of these optimal fairness-aware classifiers?
  To answer these questions, we provide three main contributions. First, we relate
  two existing fairness measures to cost-sensitive risks. Second, we show that for
  such cost-sensitive fairness measures, the optimal classifier is an instance-dependent
  thresholding of the class-probability function. Third, we relate the tradeoff between
  accuracy and fairness to the alignment between the target and sensitive featuresâ€™
  class-probabilities. A practical implication of our analysis is a simple approach
  to the fairness-aware problem which involves suitably thresholding class-probability
  estimates.'
