title: 'Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification'
section: Contributed Papers
abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate
  based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate
  bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to
  phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist  approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification
  system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis
  benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed
  of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce
  a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate
  3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned
  females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The
  maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities
  in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and
  lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial
  companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis
  algorithms.
